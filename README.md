# Tools-of-the-Trade-Linux-and-SQL
 In this course, I have explored computing skills that I will use on-the-job as a cybersecurity analyst. First, I practiced using Linux operating system commonly used by cybersecurity professionals. Used the Linux command line through the Bash shell to navigate and manage the file system and authenticate users. Then, I have used SQL to communicate with a database.

## Modules
### Module 1: Introduction to operating systems
Learned about the relationship between operating systems, hardware, and software, and became familiar with the primary functions of an operating system. Recognized common operating systems in use today and understanding how the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) both allow users to interact with the operating system.

### Module 2: The Linux operating system
Introduced to the Linux operating system and learned how it is commonly used in cybersecurity. Also learned about Linux architecture and common Linux distributions. In addition, introduced to the Linux shell and learned how it allows communication with the operating system.

### Module 3: Linux commands in the Bash shell
Introduced to Linux commands as entered through the Bash shell. Used the Bash shell to navigate and manage the file system and to authorize and authenticate users. Learned where to go for help when working with new Linux commands.

### Module 4: Databases and SQL
Practice using SQL to communicate with databases. Learned how to query a database and filter the results. Also learned how SQL can join multiple tables together in a query.
