    "## Navigate Linux and read file content\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you’ll review how to navigate the file system using Linux commands in Bash. You’ll further explore the organization of the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, review several common Linux commands for navigation and reading file content, and learn a couple of new commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you learned that the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is the component of Linux that organizes data. The FHS is important because it defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized in the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram illustrates the hierarchy of relationships under the FHS:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/753e9818-4a02-4226-bd0a-05ca99ba4fac)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the FHS, a file’s location can be described by a file path. A file path is the location of a file or directory. In the file path, the different levels of the hierarchy are separated by a forward slash (/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Root directory\n",
    "The root directory is the highest-level directory in Linux, and it’s always represented with a forward slash (/).  All subdirectories branch off the root directory. Subdirectories can continue branching out to as many levels as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard FHS directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly below the root directory, you’ll find standard FHS directories. In the diagram, home, bin, and etc are standard FHS directories. Here are a few examples of what standard directories contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/home**: Each user in the system gets their own home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/bin**: This directory stands for “binary” and contains binary files and other executables. Executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/etc**: This directory stores the system’s configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/tmp**: This directory stores many temporary files. The /tmp directory is commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify data in these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/mnt**: This directory stands for “mount” and stores media, such as USB drives and hard drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: You can use the man hier command to learn more about the FHS and its standard directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User-specific subdirectories\n",
    "Under home are subdirectories for specific users. In the diagram, these users are  analyst and analyst2. Each user has their own personal subdirectories, such as projects, logs, or reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When the path leads to a subdirectory below the user’s home directory, the user’s home directory can be represented as the tilde (~). For example, /home/analyst/logs can also be represented as ~/logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can navigate to specific subdirectories using their absolute or relative file paths. The absolute file path is the full file path, which starts from the root. For example, /home/analyst/projects is an absolute file path. The relative file path is the file path that starts from a user's current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Relative file paths can use a dot (.) to represent the current directory, or two dots (..) to represent the parent of the current directory. An example of a relative file path could be ../projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key commands for navigating the file system\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Linux commands can be used to navigate the file system: pwd, ls, and cd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key commands for navigating the file system\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Linux commands can be used to navigate the file system: pwd, ls, and cd.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### pwd\n",
    "\n",
    "The pwd command prints the working directory to the screen. Or in other words, it returns the directory that you’re currently in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output gives you the absolute path to this directory. For example, if you’re in your home directory and your username is analyst, entering pwd returns /home/analyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: To learn what your username is, use the whoami command. The whoami command returns the username of the current user. For example, if your username is analyst, entering whoami returns analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ls\n",
    "\n",
    "The ls command displays the names of the files and directories in the current working directory. For example, in the video, ls returned directories such as logs, and a file called updates.txt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you want to return the contents of a directory that’s not your current working directory, you can add an argument after ls with the absolute or relative file path to the desired directory. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory but want to list the contents of its projects subdirectory, you can enter ls /home/analyst/projects or just ls projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### cd\n",
    "\n",
    "The cd command navigates between directories. When you need to change directories, you should use this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate to a subdirectory of the current directory, you can add an argument after cd with the subdirectory name. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory and want to navigate to its projects subdirectory, you can enter cd projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also navigate to any specific directory by entering the absolute file path. For example, if you’re in /home/analyst/projects, entering cd /home/analyst/logs changes your current directory to /home/analyst/logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: You can use the relative file path and enter cd .. to go up one level in the file structure. For example, if the current directory is /home/analyst/projects, entering cd .. would change your working directory to /home/analyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common commands for reading file content\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Linux commands are useful for reading file content: cat, head, tail, and less.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### cat\n",
    "\n",
    "The cat command displays the content of a file. For example, entering cat updates.txt returns everything in the updates.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### head\n",
    "\n",
    "The head command displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines. The head command can be useful when you want to know the basic contents of a file but don’t need the full contents. Entering head updates.txt returns only the first 10 lines of the updates.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: If you want to change the number of lines returned by head, you can specify the number of lines by including -n. For example, if you only want to display the first five lines of the updates.txt file, enter head -n 5 updates.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### tail\n",
    "\n",
    "The tail command does the opposite of head. This command can be used to display just the end of a file, by default 10 lines. Entering tail updates.txt returns only the last 10 lines of the updates.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: You can use tail to read the most recent information in a log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### less\n",
    "\n",
    "The less command returns the content of a file one page at a time. For example, entering less updates.txt changes the terminal window to display the contents of updates.txt one page at a time. This allows you to easily move forward and backward through the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve accessed your content with the less command, you can use several keyboard controls to move through the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space bar: Move forward one page\n",
    "\n",
    "- b: Move back one page\n",
    "\n",
    "- Down arrow: Move forward one line\n",
    "\n",
    "- Up arrow: Move back one line\n",
    "\n",
    "- q: Quit and return to the previous terminal window\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important for security analysts to be able to navigate Linux and the file system of the FHS. Some key commands for navigating the file system include pwd, ls, and cd. Reading file content is also an important skill in the security profession. This can be done with commands such as cat, head, tail, and less. "

    "## Filter content in Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you’ll continue exploring Linux commands, which can help you filter for the information you need. You’ll learn a new Linux command, find, which can help you search files and directories for specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering for information\n",
    "You previously explored how filtering for information is an important skill for security analysts. Filtering is selecting data that match a certain condition. For example, if you had a virus in your system that only affected the .txt files, you could use filtering to find these files quickly. Filtering allows you to search based on specific criteria, such as file extension or a string of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### grep\n",
    "\n",
    "The grep command searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file containing a specified string or text. The grep command commonly takes two arguments: a specific string to search for and a specific file to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, entering grep OS updates.txt returns all lines containing OS in the updates.txt file. In this example, OS is the specific string to search for, and updates.txt is the specific file to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at another example: grep error time_logs.txt. Here grep is used to search for the text pattern. error is the term you are looking for in the time_logs.txt file. When you run this command, grep will scan the time_logs.txt file and print only the lines containing the word error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Piping\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe command is accessed using the pipe character (|). Piping sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing. As a reminder, standard output is information returned by the OS through the shell, and standard input is information received by the OS via the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe character (|) is located in various places on a keyboard. On many keyboards, it’s located on the same key as the backslash character (\\). On some keyboards, the | can look different and have a small space through the middle of the line. If you can’t find the |, search online for its location on your particular keyboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "When used with `grep`, the pipe can help you find directories and files containing a specific word in their names. For example, `ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users` returns the file and directory names in the reports directory that contain users. Before the pipe, ls indicates to list the names of the files and directories in reports. Then, it sends this output to the command after the pipe. In this case, grep users returns all of the file or directory names containing users from the input it received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Piping is a general form of redirection in Linux and can be used for multiple tasks other than filtering. You can think of piping as a general tool that you can use whenever you want the output of one command to become the input of another command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### find\n",
    "\n",
    "The find command searches for directories and files that meet specified criteria. There’s a wide range of criteria that can be specified with find. For example, you can search for files and directories that\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contain a specific string in the name,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are a certain file size, or\n",
    "\n",
    "- Were last modified within a certain time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using find, the first argument after find indicates where to start searching. For example, entering find /home/analyst/projects searches for everything starting at the projects directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this first argument, you need to indicate your criteria for the search. If you don’t include a specific search criteria with your second argument, your search will likely return a lot of directories and files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying criteria involves options. Options modify the behavior of a command and commonly begin with a hyphen (-). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### -name and -iname\n",
    "One key criteria analysts might use with find is to find file or directory names that contain a specific string. The specific string you’re searching for must be entered in quotes after the -name or -iname options. The difference between these two options is that -name is case-sensitive, and -iname is not. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to find all files in the projects directory that contain the word “log” in the file name. To do this, you’d enter `find /home/analyst/projects -name \"*log*`\". You could also enter find /home/analyst/projects `-iname` \"*log*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, the output would be all files in the projects directory that contain log surrounded by zero or more characters. The \"*log*\" portion of the command is the search criteria that indicates to search for the string “log”. When -name is the option, files with names that include Log or LOG, for example, wouldn’t be returned because this option is case-sensitive. However, they would be returned when -iname is the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: An asterisk (*) is used as a wildcard to represent zero or more unknown characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### -mtime\n",
    "\n",
    "Security analysts might also use find to find files or directories last modified within a certain time frame. The -mtime option can be used for this search. For example, entering find /home/analyst/projects -mtime -3 returns all files and directories in the projects directory that have been modified within the past three days. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `-mtime` option search is based on days, so entering -mtime +1 indicates all files or directories last modified more than one day ago, and entering -mtime -1 indicates all files or directories last modified less than one day ago. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The option -mmin can be used instead of -mtime if you want to base the search on minutes rather than days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "Filtering for information using Linux commands is an important skill for security analysts so that they can customize data to fit their needs. Three key Linux commands for this are grep, piping (|), and find. These commands can be used to navigate and filter for information in the file system."

    "\n",
    "## **Creating and modifying directories**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`mkdir`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mkdir` command creates a new directory. You can either provide the new directory as the absolute file path, which starts from the root, or as a relative file path, which starts from your current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create a new directory called `network` in your `/home/analyst/logs` directory, enter `mkdir /home/analyst/logs/network`. If you’re already in the `/home/analyst/logs` directory, you can create this new directory by entering `mkdir network`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pro Tip:* You can use the `ls` command to confirm the new directory was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`rmdir`**\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Creating and modifying files**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`touch` and `rm`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `touch` command creates a new file. This file won’t have any content inside. If your current directory is `/home/analyst/reports`, entering `touch permissions.txt` creates a new file called `permissions.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rm` command removes, or deletes, a file. To remove the `permissions.txt` file you just created, enter `rm permissions.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pro Tip:* You can verify that `permissions.txt` was successfully created or removed by entering `ls`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`mv` and `cp`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `mv` and `cp` when working with files. The `mv` command moves a file or directory to a new location, and the `cp` command copies a file or directory into a new location.\n",
    "\n",
    "To move `permissions.txt` into the `logs` subdirectory, enter `mv permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs`. To copy `permissions.txt` into the `logs` subdirectory, enter `cp permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* The `mv` command can also be used to rename files. For example, entering `mv permissions.txt perm.txt` renames the `permissions.txt` file to `perm.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **`nano` text editor**\n",
    "\n",
    "`nano` is a command-line file editor that is easy to use. To open a file in `nano`, enter `nano` followed by the file name. For example, entering `nano permissions.txt` opens it for editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save a file in `nano`, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + O`. To exit, use `Ctrl + X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Vim and Emacs are also popular command-line text editors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Standard output redirection**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write to files using standard output redirection. The `>` and `>>` operators send the output of `echo` to a file. The `>` operator overwrites the file, and `>>` appends to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, entering `echo \"last updated date\" >> permissions.txt` adds text to the file, while `echo \"time\" > permissions.txt` overwrites it.\n",
    "\n",
