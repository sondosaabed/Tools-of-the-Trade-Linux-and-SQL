    "## Navigate Linux and read file content\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you’ll review how to navigate the file system using Linux commands in Bash. You’ll further explore the organization of the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, review several common Linux commands for navigation and reading file content, and learn a couple of new commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you learned that the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is the component of Linux that organizes data. The FHS is important because it defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized in the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram illustrates the hierarchy of relationships under the FHS:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/753e9818-4a02-4226-bd0a-05ca99ba4fac)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the FHS, a file’s location can be described by a file path. A file path is the location of a file or directory. In the file path, the different levels of the hierarchy are separated by a forward slash (/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Root directory\n",
    "The root directory is the highest-level directory in Linux, and it’s always represented with a forward slash (/).  All subdirectories branch off the root directory. Subdirectories can continue branching out to as many levels as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard FHS directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly below the root directory, you’ll find standard FHS directories. In the diagram, home, bin, and etc are standard FHS directories. Here are a few examples of what standard directories contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/home**: Each user in the system gets their own home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/bin**: This directory stands for “binary” and contains binary files and other executables. Executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/etc**: This directory stores the system’s configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/tmp**: This directory stores many temporary files. The /tmp directory is commonly used by attackers because anyone in the system can modify data in these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/mnt**: This directory stands for “mount” and stores media, such as USB drives and hard drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: You can use the man hier command to learn more about the FHS and its standard directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User-specific subdirectories\n",
    "Under home are subdirectories for specific users. In the diagram, these users are  analyst and analyst2. Each user has their own personal subdirectories, such as projects, logs, or reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When the path leads to a subdirectory below the user’s home directory, the user’s home directory can be represented as the tilde (~). For example, /home/analyst/logs can also be represented as ~/logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can navigate to specific subdirectories using their absolute or relative file paths. The absolute file path is the full file path, which starts from the root. For example, /home/analyst/projects is an absolute file path. The relative file path is the file path that starts from a user's current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Relative file paths can use a dot (.) to represent the current directory, or two dots (..) to represent the parent of the current directory. An example of a relative file path could be ../projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key commands for navigating the file system\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Linux commands can be used to navigate the file system: pwd, ls, and cd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key commands for navigating the file system\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Linux commands can be used to navigate the file system: pwd, ls, and cd.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### pwd\n",
    "\n",
    "The pwd command prints the working directory to the screen. Or in other words, it returns the directory that you’re currently in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output gives you the absolute path to this directory. For example, if you’re in your home directory and your username is analyst, entering pwd returns /home/analyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: To learn what your username is, use the whoami command. The whoami command returns the username of the current user. For example, if your username is analyst, entering whoami returns analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ls\n",
    "\n",
    "The ls command displays the names of the files and directories in the current working directory. For example, in the video, ls returned directories such as logs, and a file called updates.txt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you want to return the contents of a directory that’s not your current working directory, you can add an argument after ls with the absolute or relative file path to the desired directory. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory but want to list the contents of its projects subdirectory, you can enter ls /home/analyst/projects or just ls projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### cd\n",
    "\n",
    "The cd command navigates between directories. When you need to change directories, you should use this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate to a subdirectory of the current directory, you can add an argument after cd with the subdirectory name. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory and want to navigate to its projects subdirectory, you can enter cd projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also navigate to any specific directory by entering the absolute file path. For example, if you’re in /home/analyst/projects, entering cd /home/analyst/logs changes your current directory to /home/analyst/logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: You can use the relative file path and enter cd .. to go up one level in the file structure. For example, if the current directory is /home/analyst/projects, entering cd .. would change your working directory to /home/analyst. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common commands for reading file content\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Linux commands are useful for reading file content: cat, head, tail, and less.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### cat\n",
    "\n",
    "The cat command displays the content of a file. For example, entering cat updates.txt returns everything in the updates.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### head\n",
    "\n",
    "The head command displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines. The head command can be useful when you want to know the basic contents of a file but don’t need the full contents. Entering head updates.txt returns only the first 10 lines of the updates.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: If you want to change the number of lines returned by head, you can specify the number of lines by including -n. For example, if you only want to display the first five lines of the updates.txt file, enter head -n 5 updates.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### tail\n",
    "\n",
    "The tail command does the opposite of head. This command can be used to display just the end of a file, by default 10 lines. Entering tail updates.txt returns only the last 10 lines of the updates.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: You can use tail to read the most recent information in a log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### less\n",
    "\n",
    "The less command returns the content of a file one page at a time. For example, entering less updates.txt changes the terminal window to display the contents of updates.txt one page at a time. This allows you to easily move forward and backward through the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve accessed your content with the less command, you can use several keyboard controls to move through the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space bar: Move forward one page\n",
    "\n",
    "- b: Move back one page\n",
    "\n",
    "- Down arrow: Move forward one line\n",
    "\n",
    "- Up arrow: Move back one line\n",
    "\n",
    "- q: Quit and return to the previous terminal window\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important for security analysts to be able to navigate Linux and the file system of the FHS. Some key commands for navigating the file system include pwd, ls, and cd. Reading file content is also an important skill in the security profession. This can be done with commands such as cat, head, tail, and less. "

    "## Filter content in Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you’ll continue exploring Linux commands, which can help you filter for the information you need. You’ll learn a new Linux command, find, which can help you search files and directories for specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering for information\n",
    "You previously explored how filtering for information is an important skill for security analysts. Filtering is selecting data that match a certain condition. For example, if you had a virus in your system that only affected the .txt files, you could use filtering to find these files quickly. Filtering allows you to search based on specific criteria, such as file extension or a string of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### grep\n",
    "\n",
    "The grep command searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file containing a specified string or text. The grep command commonly takes two arguments: a specific string to search for and a specific file to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, entering grep OS updates.txt returns all lines containing OS in the updates.txt file. In this example, OS is the specific string to search for, and updates.txt is the specific file to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at another example: grep error time_logs.txt. Here grep is used to search for the text pattern. error is the term you are looking for in the time_logs.txt file. When you run this command, grep will scan the time_logs.txt file and print only the lines containing the word error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Piping\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe command is accessed using the pipe character (|). Piping sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing. As a reminder, standard output is information returned by the OS through the shell, and standard input is information received by the OS via the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe character (|) is located in various places on a keyboard. On many keyboards, it’s located on the same key as the backslash character (\\). On some keyboards, the | can look different and have a small space through the middle of the line. If you can’t find the |, search online for its location on your particular keyboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "When used with `grep`, the pipe can help you find directories and files containing a specific word in their names. For example, `ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users` returns the file and directory names in the reports directory that contain users. Before the pipe, ls indicates to list the names of the files and directories in reports. Then, it sends this output to the command after the pipe. In this case, grep users returns all of the file or directory names containing users from the input it received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Piping is a general form of redirection in Linux and can be used for multiple tasks other than filtering. You can think of piping as a general tool that you can use whenever you want the output of one command to become the input of another command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### find\n",
    "\n",
    "The find command searches for directories and files that meet specified criteria. There’s a wide range of criteria that can be specified with find. For example, you can search for files and directories that\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contain a specific string in the name,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are a certain file size, or\n",
    "\n",
    "- Were last modified within a certain time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using find, the first argument after find indicates where to start searching. For example, entering find /home/analyst/projects searches for everything starting at the projects directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this first argument, you need to indicate your criteria for the search. If you don’t include a specific search criteria with your second argument, your search will likely return a lot of directories and files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying criteria involves options. Options modify the behavior of a command and commonly begin with a hyphen (-). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### -name and -iname\n",
    "One key criteria analysts might use with find is to find file or directory names that contain a specific string. The specific string you’re searching for must be entered in quotes after the -name or -iname options. The difference between these two options is that -name is case-sensitive, and -iname is not. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to find all files in the projects directory that contain the word “log” in the file name. To do this, you’d enter `find /home/analyst/projects -name \"*log*`\". You could also enter find /home/analyst/projects `-iname` \"*log*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, the output would be all files in the projects directory that contain log surrounded by zero or more characters. The \"*log*\" portion of the command is the search criteria that indicates to search for the string “log”. When -name is the option, files with names that include Log or LOG, for example, wouldn’t be returned because this option is case-sensitive. However, they would be returned when -iname is the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: An asterisk (*) is used as a wildcard to represent zero or more unknown characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### -mtime\n",
    "\n",
    "Security analysts might also use find to find files or directories last modified within a certain time frame. The -mtime option can be used for this search. For example, entering find /home/analyst/projects -mtime -3 returns all files and directories in the projects directory that have been modified within the past three days. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `-mtime` option search is based on days, so entering -mtime +1 indicates all files or directories last modified more than one day ago, and entering -mtime -1 indicates all files or directories last modified less than one day ago. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The option -mmin can be used instead of -mtime if you want to base the search on minutes rather than days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "Filtering for information using Linux commands is an important skill for security analysts so that they can customize data to fit their needs. Three key Linux commands for this are grep, piping (|), and find. These commands can be used to navigate and filter for information in the file system."

    "## **Creating and modifying directories**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`mkdir`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mkdir` command creates a new directory. You can either provide the new directory as the absolute file path, which starts from the root, or as a relative file path, which starts from your current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to create a new directory called `network` in your `/home/analyst/logs` directory, enter `mkdir /home/analyst/logs/network`. If you’re already in the `/home/analyst/logs` directory, you can create this new directory by entering `mkdir network`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **`touch` and `rm`**\n",

    "The `touch` command creates a new file. This file won’t have any content inside. If your current directory is `/home/analyst/reports`, entering `touch permissions.txt` creates a new file called `permissions.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rm` command removes, or deletes, a file. To remove the `permissions.txt` file you just created, enter `rm permissions.txt`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To move `permissions.txt` into the `logs` subdirectory, enter `mv permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs`. To copy `permissions.txt` into the `logs` subdirectory, enter `cp permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Standard output redirection**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write to files using standard output redirection. The `>` and `>>` operators send the output of `echo` to a file. The `>` operator overwrites the file, and `>>` appends to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, entering `echo \"last updated date\" >> permissions.txt` adds text to the file, while `echo \"time\" > permissions.txt` overwrites it.\n",

    "### Exploring existing permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the ls command to investigate who has permissions on files and directories. Previously, you learned that ls displays the names of files in directories in the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional options you can add to the ls command to make your command more specific. Some of these options provide details about permissions. Here are a few important ls options for security analysts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ls -a`: Displays hidden files. Hidden files start with a period (.) at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ls -l`: Displays permissions to files and directories. Also displays other additional information, including owner name, group, file size, and the time of last modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ls -la`: Displays permissions to files and directories, including hidden files. This is a combination of the other two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of least privilege is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function. In other words, users should not have privileges that are beyond what is necessary. Not following the principle of least privilege can create security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chmod  command can help you manage this authorization. The chmod command changes permissions on files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using chmod\n",
    "The chmod command requires two arguments. The first argument indicates how to change permissions, and the second argument indicates the file or directory that you want to change permissions for.  For example, the following command would add all permissions to login_sessions.txt:\n",
    "\n",
    "`chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx login_sessions.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to take all the permissions away, you could use\n",
    "\n",
    "`chmod u-rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx login_sessions.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to assign these permissions is to use the equals sign (=) in this first argument. Using = with chmod sets, or assigns, the permissions exactly as specified. For example, the following command would set read permissions for login_sessions.txt for user, group, and other:\n",
    "\n",
    "chmod u=r,g=r,o=r login_sessions.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "This command overwrites existing permissions. For instance, if the user previously had write permissions, these write permissions are removed after you specify only read permissions with =. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following table reviews how each character is used within the first argument of chmod:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Character | Description                                         |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| u         | indicates changes will be made to user permissions  |\n",
    "| g         | indicates changes will be made to group permissions |\n",
    "| o         | indicates changes will be made to other permissions |\n",
    "| +         | adds permissions to the user, group, or other       |\n",
    "| -         | removes permissions from the user, group, or other  |\n",
    "| =         | assigns permissions for the user, group, or other   |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When there are permission changes to more than one owner type, commas are needed to separate changes for each owner type. You should not add spaces after those commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The principle of least privilege in action\n",
    "As a security analyst, you may encounter a situation like this one: There’s a file called bonuses.txt within a compensation directory. The owner of this file is a member of the Human Resources department with a username of hrrep1. It has been decided that hrrep1 needs access to this file. But, since this file contains confidential information, no one else in the hr group needs access.\n",
    "\n",
    "You run ls -l to check the permissions of files in the compensation directory and discover that the permissions for bonuses.txt are -rw-rw----. The group owner type has read and write permissions that do not align with the principle of least privilege.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy the situation, you input chmod g-rw bonuses.txt. Now, only the user who needs to access this file to carry out their job responsibilities can access this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "Managing directory and file permissions may be a part of your work as a security analyst. Using ls with the -l and -la options allows you to investigate directory and file permissions. Using chmod allows you to change user permissions and ensure they are aligned with the principle of least privilege."

    "## **Responsible use of `sudo`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you explored authorization, authentication, and Linux commands with `sudo`, `useradd`, and `userdel`. The `sudo` command is important for security analysts because it allows users to have elevated permissions without risking the system by running commands as the root user. You’ll continue exploring authorization, authentication, and Linux commands in this reading and learn two more commands that can be used with `sudo`: `usermod` and `chown`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Responsible use of `sudo`**\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage authorization and authentication, you need to be a root user, or a user with elevated privileges to modify the system. The root user can also be called the “super user.” You become a root user by logging in as the root user. However, running commands as the root user is not recommended in Linux because it can create security risks if malicious actors compromise that account. It’s also easy to make irreversible mistakes, and the system can’t track who ran a command. For these reasons, rather than logging in as the root user, it’s recommended you use `sudo` in Linux when you need elevated privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sudo` command temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users. The name of this command comes from “super user do.” Users must be given access in a configuration file to use `sudo`. This file is called the “sudoers file.” Although using `sudo` is preferable to logging in as the root user, it's important to be aware that users with the elevated permissions to use `sudo` might be more at risk in the event of an attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare this to a hotel with a master key. The master key can be used to access any room in the hotel. There are some workers at the hotel who need this key to perform their work. For example, to clean all the rooms, the janitor would scan their ID badge and then use this master key. However, if someone outside the hotel’s network gained access to the janitor’s ID badge and master key, they could access any room in the hotel. In this example, the janitor with the master key represents a user using `sudo` for elevated privileges. Because of the dangers of `sudo`, only users who really need to use it should have these permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, even if you need access to `sudo`, you should be careful about using it with only the commands you need and nothing more. Running commands with `sudo` allows users to bypass the typical security controls that are in place to prevent elevated access to an attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Be aware of `sudo` if copying commands from an online source. It’s important you don’t use `sudo` accidentally. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Authentication and authorization with `sudo`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `sudo` with many authentication and authorization management tasks. As a reminder, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, and authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. Some of the key commands used for these tasks include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`useradd`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `useradd` command adds a user to the system. To add a user with the username of `fgarcia` with `sudo`, enter `sudo useradd fgarcia`. There are additional options you can use with `useradd`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-g`: Sets the user’s default group, also called their primary group\n",
    "- `-G`: Adds the user to additional groups, also called supplemental or secondary groups\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `-g` option, the primary group must be specified after `-g`. For example, entering `sudo useradd -g security fgarcia` adds `fgarcia` as a new user and assigns their primary group to be `security`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `-G` option, the supplemental group must be passed into the command after `-G`. You can add more than one supplemental group at a time with the `-G` option. Entering `sudo useradd -G finance,admin fgarcia` adds `fgarcia` as a new user and adds them to the existing `finance` and `admin` groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`usermod`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `usermod` command modifies existing user accounts. The same `-g` and `-G` options from the `useradd` command can be used with `usermod` if a user already exists. \n",
    "\n",
    "To change the primary group of an existing user, you need the `-g` option. For example, entering `sudo usermod -g executive fgarcia` would change `fgarcia`’s primary group to the `executive` group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a supplemental group for an existing user, you need the `-G` option. You also need a `-a` option, which appends the user to an existing group and is only used with the `-G` option. For example, entering `sudo usermod -a -G marketing fgarcia` would add the existing `fgarcia` user to the supplemental `marketing` group.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* When changing the supplemental group of an existing user, if you don't include the `-a` option, `-G` will replace any existing supplemental groups with the groups specified after `usermod`. Using `-a` with `-G` ensures that the new groups are added but existing groups are not replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other options you can use with `usermod` to specify how you want to modify the user, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-d`: Changes the user’s home directory.\n",
    "- `-l`: Changes the user’s login name.\n",
    "- `-L`: Locks the account so the user can’t log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The option always goes after the `usermod` command. For example, to change `fgarcia`’s home directory to `/home/garcia_f`, enter `sudo usermod -d /home/garcia_f fgarcia`. The option `-d` directly follows the command `usermod` before the other two needed arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`userdel`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `userdel` command deletes a user from the system. For example, entering `sudo userdel fgarcia` deletes `fgarcia` as a user. Be careful before you delete a user using this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `userdel` command doesn’t delete the files in the user’s home directory unless you use the `-r` option. Entering `sudo userdel -r fgarcia` would delete `fgarcia` as a user and delete all files in their home directory. Before deleting any user files, you should ensure you have backups in case you need them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Instead of deleting the user, you could consider deactivating their account with `usermod -L`. This prevents the user from logging in while still giving you access to their account and associated permissions. For example, if a user left an organization, this option would allow you to identify which files they have ownership over, so you could move this ownership to other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **`chown`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `chown` command changes ownership of a file or directory. You can use `chown` to change user or group ownership. To change the user owner of the `access.txt` file to `fgarcia`, enter `sudo chown fgarcia access.txt`. To change the group owner of `access.txt` to `security`, enter `sudo chown :security access.txt`. You must enter a colon (`:`) before `security` to designate it as a group name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to `useradd`, `usermod`, and `userdel`, there are additional options that can be used with `chown`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is the process of a user verifying their identity, and authorization is the process of determining what they have access to. You can use the `sudo` command to temporarily run commands with elevated privileges to complete authentication and authorization management tasks. Specifically, `useradd`, `userdel`, `usermod`, and `chown` can be used to manage users and file ownership.\n"
