    "## Linux architecture explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the Linux architecture is important for a security analyst. When you understand how a system is organized, it makes it easier to understand how it functions. In this reading, you’ll learn more about the individual components in the Linux architecture. A request to complete a task starts with the user and then flows through applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, the kernel, and the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User\n",
    "The user is the person interacting with a computer. They initiate and manage computer tasks. Linux is a multi-user system, which means that multiple users can use the same resources at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "An application is a program that performs a specific task. There are many different applications on your computer. Some applications typically come pre-installed on your computer, such as calculators or calendars. Other applications might have to be installed, such as some web browsers or email clients. In Linux, you'll often use a package manager to install applications. A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shell\n",
    "The shell is the command-line interpreter. Everything entered into the shell is text based. The shell allows users to give commands to the kernel and receive responses from it. You can think of the shell as a translator between you and your computer. The shell translates the commands you enter so that the computer can perform the tasks you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)\n",
    "The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is the component of the Linux OS that organizes data. It specifies the location where data is stored in the operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A directory is a file that organizes where other files are stored. Directories are sometimes called “folders,” and they can contain files or other directories. The FHS defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage is organized so the operating system knows where to find specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel\n",
    "The kernel is the component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory. It communicates with the applications to route commands. The Linux kernel is unique to the Linux OS and is critical for allocating resources in the system. The kernel controls all major functions of the hardware, which can help get tasks expedited more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware\n",
    "The hardware is the physical components of a computer. You might be familiar with some hardware components, such as hard drives or CPUs. Hardware is categorized as either peripheral or internal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Peripheral devices\n",
    "Peripheral devices are hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system. They are not core components needed to run the computer system. Peripheral devices can be added or removed freely. Examples of peripheral devices include monitors, printers, the keyboard, and the mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internal hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal hardware are the components required to run the computer. Internal hardware includes a main circuit board and all components attached to it. This main circuit board is also called the motherboard. Internal hardware includes the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a computer’s main processor, which is used to perform general computing tasks on a computer. The CPU executes the instructions provided by programs, which enables these programs to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Access Memory (RAM) is a hardware component used for short-term memory. It’s where data is stored temporarily as you perform tasks on your computer. For example, if you’re writing a report on your computer, the data needed for this is stored in RAM. After you’ve finished writing the report and closed down that program, this data is deleted from RAM. Information in RAM cannot be accessed once the computer has been turned off. The CPU takes the data from RAM to run programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The hard drive is a hardware component used for long-term memory. It’s where programs and files are stored for the computer to access later. Information on the hard drive can be accessed even after a computer has been turned off and on again. A computer can have multiple hard drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "It’s important for security analysts to understand the Linux architecture and how these components are organized. The components of the Linux architecture are the user, applications, shell, Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, kernel, and hardware. Each of these components is important in how Linux functions. "

    "## More Linux distributions\n",
    "Previously, you were introduced to the different distributions of Linux. This included KALI LINUX ™. (KALI LINUX ™ is a trademark of OffSec.) In addition to KALI LINUX ™, there are multiple other Linux distributions that security analysts should be familiar with. In this reading, you’ll learn about additional Linux distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KALI LINUX ™\n",
    "KALI LINUX ™ is an open-source distribution of Linux that is widely used in the security industry. This is because KALI LINUX ™, which is Debian-based, is pre-installed with many useful tools for penetration testing and digital forensics. A penetration test is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. Digital forensics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened after an attack. These are key activities in the security industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, KALI LINUX ™ is not the only Linux distribution that is used in cybersecurity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ubuntu\n",
    "Ubuntu is an open-source, user-friendly distribution that is widely used in security and other industries. It has both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). Ubuntu is also Debian-derived and includes common applications by default. Users can also download many more applications from a package manager, including security-focused tools. Because of its wide use, Ubuntu has an especially large number of community resources to support users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ubuntu is also widely used for cloud computing. As organizations migrate to cloud servers, cybersecurity work may more regularly involve Ubuntu derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parrot\n",
    "Parrot is an open-source distribution that is commonly used for security. Similar to KALI LINUX ™, Parrot comes with pre-installed tools related to penetration testing and digital forensics. Like both KALI LINUX ™ and Ubuntu, it is based on Debian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parrot is also considered to be a user-friendly Linux distribution. This is because it has a GUI that many find easy to navigate. This is in addition to Parrot’s CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®\n",
    "Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a subscription-based distribution of Linux built for enterprise use. Red Hat is not free, which is a major difference from the previously mentioned distributions. Because it’s built and supported for enterprise use, Red Hat also offers a dedicated support team for customers to call about issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CentOS\n",
    "CentOS is an open-source distribution that is closely related to Red Hat. It uses source code published by Red Hat to provide a similar platform. However, CentOS does not offer the same enterprise support that Red Hat provides and is supported through the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "KALI LINUX ™, Ubuntu, Parrot, Red Hat, and CentOS are all widely used Linux distributions. It’s important for security analysts to be aware of these distributions that they might encounter in their career."

    "## Package managers for installing applications\n",
    "Previously, you learned about Linux distributions and that different distributions derive from different sources, such as Debian or Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution. You were also introduced to package managers, and learned that Linux applications are commonly distributed through package managers. In this reading, you’ll apply this knowledge to learn more about package managers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to package managers\n",
    "A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application. Some packages may be large enough to form applications on their own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packages contain the files necessary for an application to be installed. These files include dependencies, which are supplemental files used to run an application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Package managers can help resolve any issues with dependencies and perform other management tasks. A package manager is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. Linux uses multiple package managers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It’s important to use the most recent version of a package when possible. The most recent version has the most up-to-date bug fixes and security patches. These help keep your system more secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of package managers\n",
    "Many commonly used Linux distributions are derived from the same parent distribution. For example, KALI LINUX ™, Ubuntu, and Parrot all come from Debian. CentOS comes from Red Hat.\n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge is useful when installing applications because certain package managers work with certain distributions. For example, the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) can be used for Linux distributions derived from Red Hat, and package managers such as dpkg can be used for Linux distributions derived from Debian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different package managers typically use different file extensions. For example, Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) has files which use the `.rpm` file extension, such as Package-Version-Release_Architecture.rpm. Package managers for Debian-derived Linux distributions, such as dpkg, have files which use the `.deb` file extension, such as Package_Version-Release_Architecture.deb.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package management tools\n",
    "In addition to package managers like RPM and dpkg, there are also package management tools that allow you to easily work with packages through the shell. Package management tools are sometimes utilized instead of package managers because they allow users to more easily perform basic tasks, such as installing a new package. Two notable tools are the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Package Tool (APT) \n",
    "APT is a tool used with Debian-derived distributions. It is run from the command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM)\n",
    "YUM is a tool used with Red Hat-derived distributions. It is run from the command-line interface to manage, search, and install packages. YUM works with .rpm files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application. Packages can be managed using a package manager. There are multiple package managers and package management tools for different Linux distributions. Package management tools allow users to easily work with packages through the shell. Debian-derived Linux distributions use package managers like dpkg as well as package management tools like Advanced Package Tool (APT). Red Hat-derived distributions use the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) or tools like Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM).\n"
